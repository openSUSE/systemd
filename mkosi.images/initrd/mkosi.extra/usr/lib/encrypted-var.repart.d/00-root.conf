# This UUID is the decrypted partition UUID, there are also filesystem and luks UUIDs.
# The original test finds the partition by this UUID, but it doesn't appear
# since the luks UUID, which is derived by hash of this UUID, is different
# and the luks UUID is needed before the decrypted partition UUID.
# The resulting luks UUID is 0d318174-56b0-4d6e-a324-ac1e7e7d235d.
