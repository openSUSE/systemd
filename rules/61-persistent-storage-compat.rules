# Do not edit this file, it will be overwritten on update.

# This file contains *depecrated* rules kept only for backward
# compatibility reasons. Indeed upstream has the bad habit to change
# symlink naming schemes hence breaking systems using the old schemes.
#
# If your system uses one of the symlinks generated by these compat
# rules (usually in /etc/fstab), we encourage you to replace the
# relevant paths with the new ones (symlinks generated by
# 60-persistent-storage.rules).
#
# You might check if your system relies on one of those compat symlinks
# by disabling their creation at boot time. To do so, append
# "udev.compat_symlink_generation=0" to the kernel command line. If
# your system works flawlessly, there's a good chance that your system
# doesn't rely on them and they could be disabled permanently.
#
# Thanks !
#
# Note: this rules file can rely on all ID_* variables (set by
# 60-persistent-storage.rule) but should not overwrite them, see
# bsc#1048679 for details.

# NVMe symlinks were introduced first via a SUSE specific commit
# (bsc#944132) and upstream gained support later but of course using a
# different scheme.

# The SCSI translation layer for NVMe devices has been removed from
# the kernel since 4.13, therefore we switched from scsi_id to the
# sysfs interface to generate the name of the compat symlinks.
# Unfortunately we can't use %s{model} to retrieve the model string
# because udev strips any trailing whitespaces and some plateforms
# (QEMU does that) might append such chars. In those cases scsi_id was
# replacing them with a single trailing '_'. Therefore the currently
# code retrieves the model string manually making sure to preserve all
# characters so trailing whitespaces are still converted when the
# symlink is created.
